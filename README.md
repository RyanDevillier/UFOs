# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a webpage that displays filterable data about UFO sightings from different locations around the world.  Our goal was to make the webpage so that the user could filter through the main table and display only the data that they would be interested in.  The filtering options allow for the user to input specific criteria, such as the date of the sighting, the city, state, and country in which the sighting occurred, and what shape the UFO was that was spotted in the sky.  These different filtering options can be used simultaneously, allowing the user to search for very specific UFO sightings.

## Results
Using the webpage is very simple.  First, upon opening the webpage, we are shown a brief description of the motivation behind building the UFO sightings table.

Below this description, we see a table that contains over 100 rows of UFO sighting data.  To the left of this table, it is apparent that there are multiple filtering options that we can use in order to search for specific sightings we may be interested in.

In order to make a search using the filtering options on the left side of the webpage, all that the user needs to do is input search criteria and press the “Enter” key on their keyboard.  For example, if we wanted to filter the original dataset to show only UFO sightings from 1/5/2010, we would type in “1/5/2010” in the “Enter Date” filter box and then press “Enter”.  Upon doing this, we see that we get seven results.

If we wanted to make our search even more specific, we could, for instance, search for only sightings that occurred in New Jersey by typing in “nj” in the “Enter a State” filter box and then pressing “Enter”.

We see now that we get two results, both from the state of New Jersey.  Finally, if we wanted to get only the result from the city of Clinton, New Jersey, we could input “clinton” into the “Enter a City” filter box and press “Enter”.

We see that we get only one result: the sighting on 1/5/2010 from Clinton, New Jersey.  If at any point we wanted to go back to the original, unfiltered data table, we could erase all of our inputs from the filter boxes and press “Enter”, and we would be returned the original table with all of the UFO sightings available to be viewed.  Another way to clear all filtered searches and return to the original table is to press the “UFO Sightings” header at the top-left-most corner of the webpage.

## Summary
Overall, our webpage does a good job of filtering through the data in our table.  However, a problem worth noting is that if a user wants to find a specific sighting, they have to use the date, city, state, country, and shape inputs to get back to the sighting that they were interested in.  We could alleviate this inconvenience by having ID numbers on each sighting, and then allow users to filter their search based on ID number.  This would prevent users from having to re-type every filter to get back to the specific entry they are interested in viewing.  It would also be very beneficial to gather more data and place it into our table.  This would allow for users to not only search through more sightings, but it would allow us to generate meaningful summary statistics and other conclusions about UFO sightings that users of our webpage would enjoy seeing.  Finally, it is apparent that the data in our table contains typos and does not follow a specific structure (specifically in the “Duration” and “Comments” sections).  Cleaning this data would not only make the table more visually appealing, but it could allow us to create additional filters, such as a “Duration” filter, in which the user could input a length of time in seconds or minutes that would correspond to the appropriate sightings in the table.
